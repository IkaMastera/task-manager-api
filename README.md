# ðŸ§ª Task Manager API - QA Automation & DevOps Portfolio Project

Welcome to my QA Automation + DevOps showcase project. This repo demonstrates how to build a reliable, testable, and containerized API testing pipeline using modern tools and best practices.

--

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world QA Automation + DevOps workflow by:

- Writing API tests using `pytest`
- Running tests inside Docker containers
- Automating test pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Adding logging, error handling, and load testing
- Demonstrating CI/CD skills and Linux fundamentals
